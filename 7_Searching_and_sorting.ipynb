    "### 7.10 Merge Sort vs Quick Sort\n",
    "* The merge sort algorithm performs in the exact same and precise manner regardless of the number of elements involved in the sorting\n",
    "* It works fine well with the large data set\n",
    "* Quick sort is faster than merge sort in some cases such as for small data sets\n",
    "* Merge sort requires additional memory space to store the auxiliary arrays, **O(n)**\n",
    "    - On the other hand, the quick sort doesn’t require much space for extra storage\n",
    "* Merge sort is more efficient than quick sort\n",
    "* The quick sort is internal sorting method where the data that is to be sorted is adjusted at a time in main memory\n",
    "    - Conversely, the merge sort is external sorting method\n",
    "        - Where the data that is to be sorted cannot be accommodated in the memory, at the same time. So some has to be kept in the auxiliary memory\n",
    "\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "### 7.10.1 Conculsion\n",
    "* The quick sort is faster for smaller lists but is inefficient for larger lists. \n",
    "* It also performs a lot of comparisons as compared to merge sort. \n",
    "* Although, merge sort requires less comparison it needs an additional memory space of **0(n)**, for storing the extra array while quick sort needs space of **O(log n)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "### 7.10.2 Considerations\n",
    "**Why Quick Sort is preferred over MergeSort for sorting Arrays**\n",
    "* Quick Sort in its general form is an in-place sort (i.e. it doesn’t require any extra storage) whereas merge sort requires O(N) extra storage, N denoting the array size which may be quite expensive. Allocating and de-allocating the extra space used for merge sort increases the running time of the algorithm. Comparing average complexity we find that both type of sorts have O(NlogN) average complexity but the constants differ. For arrays, merge sort loses due to the use of extra O(N) storage space.  \n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why MergeSort is preferred over QuickSort for Linked Lists?**\n",
    "* In case of linked lists the case is different mainly due to difference in memory allocation of arrays and linked lists. Unlike arrays, linked list nodes may not be adjacent in memory. Unlike array, in linked list, we can insert items in the middle in O(1) extra space and O(1) time. Therefore merge operation of merge sort can be implemented without extra space for linked lists.  \n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "* In arrays, we can do random access as elements are continuous in memory. Let us say we have an integer (4-byte) array A and let the address of A[0] be x then to access A[i], we can directly access the memory at (x + i*4). Unlike arrays, we can not do random access in linked list. Quick Sort requires a lot of this kind of access. In linked list to access i’th index, we have to travel each and every node from the head to i’th node as we don’t have continuous block of memory. Therefore, the overhead increases for quick sort. Merge sort accesses data sequentially and the need of random access is low."
